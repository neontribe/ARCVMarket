                  <p>ARC takes your privacy very seriously. The policies and procedures we have in place are to protect the integrity and confidentiality of personal information, to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other UK and EU regulations.</p>

                  <p>Within the Data Protection Act 1998, Personal Data is defined as data that relates to a living individual who can be identified:</p>

                  </ul>

                  <p>By providing us with your Personal Data when using Rosie, or setting up an account to use Rosie, you give your consent that all Personal Data that you submit may be processed by us in the manner and for the purposes described below.
